# Computer graphics
Rust using opengl for computer graphics.

This repo is for my classes only, but if you came here and have any question i'm happy to answered it! :).

# Projects
The "big" projects has it's own bin, while the things i do in class
or for testing are inside the examples folder, either way i run
each with `cargo run --example [name]`.

## Links
Because i don't really have an idea of what i'm doing, a good part of this code is just an
implementation from other people's code.

- For the translation, rotation & scaling algorithms i saw
[OGLDEV](https://github.com/emeiri/ogldev/tree/master/tutorial06) repo.
