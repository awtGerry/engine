# Pacman animation
Project for computer graphics about an animation that needs
to last at least a whole minute.

The project will use transformations and methods to fill figures like circle
and rectangle (in this case).

NOTE: This isn't a pacman game, just an animation but if wanted to implemented as a
game shouldn't be hard to do (probably easier than the animation).
